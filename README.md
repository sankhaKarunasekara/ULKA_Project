## Naming Convention

Since we are some what experiance in this we don't need to rename the discovery after naming it from `ULK0001`.

* Since this is our 2nd time let's use `ULK1***` as our naming convention. 1st digit represents the campaign. (note - first time we used `ULK0***`).
* Form second digit lets identify ourselfs, 
  
   | # | Member | Convention |
   |--|--------|------------ |
   |1 | Sankha | `ULK11**` |
   |2 | Sithum | `ULK12**` |
   |3 | Pulasthi | `ULK13**`|
   |4 | Amila | `ULK14**`|
   |5 | Sama | `ULK15**`|

* Remaining two digits should represent the new moving object number let's go from 01 to 99.
* Please keep track of your object count, don't repeat yourself. 

* Ex: 
   Amila's 1st discovery in this campain should be named as: `ULK1401`  
   Sithum's 5th discovery in this campain should be named as: `ULK1205`
