## Naming Convention

Since we are some what experiance in this we don't need to rename the discovery after naming it from `ULK-0001`.

* Since this is our 2nd time let's use `ULK-1***` as our naming convention. 1st digit represents the campaign. (note - first time we used `ULK-0***`).
* Form second digit lets identify ourselfs, 
  
 # | Member | Convention  
---------------------------
   1) | Sankha | `ULK-11**`
   2) | Sithum | `ULK-12**`
   3) | Pulasthi | `ULK-13**`
   4) | Amila | `ULK-14**`
   5) | Sama | `ULK-15**`

* Remaining two digits should represent the new moving object number let's go from 01 to 99.
* Keep track of your number please don't repeat same number twice. 

Ex: 
   Amila's 1st discovery in this campain should be named as: `ULK-1301`  
   Sithum's 5th discovery in this campain should be named as: `ULK-1205`
